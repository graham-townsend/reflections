How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It displayed each line that was different ratehr than having to look at the entire files, line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

More code commits so you can roll back easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - Commit when you want and with logical functions, better idea of when it should be commited
Cons - Not often enough, too often, too big of a change or too small

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The files are all related to one another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives you the versions of the files with the IDs. You can then use diff to get the changes between two IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can revert back to an old version with "checkout"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
